nsfxr
=====

A C# / .Net port of [sfxr]
(http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html). 

Originally a fork of [usfxr](https://github.com/zeh/usfxr) but that was too heavily coupled to [Unity](http://unity3d.com) and it was easier to rewrite the whole thing based on sfxr.

Uses nFMOD. No sound caching - this is assumped to be a function of the host, not the sound generation library.
